    "sfomuseum:description": "\"Women on the Grand Tour \" is a collection of vintage photographs of women traveling throughout England, France, and Italy during the nineteenth century. From 1660 to 1820, the Grand Tour was a European travel itinerary that was considered an educational right of passage for the wealthy. The adventure included a study of the cultural artifacts of antiquity, the art of the Renaissance, and exposure to fashionable European society. \r\rThe Grand Tour, a privilege that at one time was only reserved for men, became a means for some women to become informed, social commentators and discerning cultural critics. \"Women on the Grand Tour\" presents images of nineteenth century Europe imbued with a feminine sensibility of freedom, social independence, and romance.",
