    "sfomuseum:description":"This exhibition features thirty different design projects from firms and individuals throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. From preliminary sketches and drawings to detailed illustrations, and from basic models and prototypes to finished products, a range of design solutions are presented by a number of designers from an area known as a hotbed of creativity. The design projects include a compact juicer, an intuitive and portable photo printer, an electronic abacus, a teapot designed to brew the perfect cup of tea, and a handbag made from recycled parachutes and drapery. The exhibition will coincide with the IDSA/ICSID International Design conference held in San Francisco in October of 2008.",
