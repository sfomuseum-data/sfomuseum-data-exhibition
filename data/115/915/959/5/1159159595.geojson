    "sfomuseum:description": "Generations in Clay: Southwestern Pottery from the California Academy of Sciences presents approximately 125 works of pottery from 900 CE to the 1990s that explore the development of distinct pottery styles by different American Indian groups from the Southwestern United States.  The exhibition features the work of renowned potters Lucy Lewis, Nampeyo, Margaret Tafoya and-perhaps best-known American Indian potter in the history of the art form-Maria Martinez.  While highlighting their individual careers, the exhibition also traces the artistsâ€™ influence on the work produced by subsequent generations of potters.",
