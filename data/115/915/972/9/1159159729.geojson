Artists and collectors both are attracted to its design challenge. The Diane and Sandy Besser Collection of contemporary teapots, which represents their personal choices as well as many important trends in twentieth-century ceramic art, is a recent gift to the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. The collection is being exhibited at San Francisco Airport Museums in anticipation of the reopening of the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in September 2005.",
