    "sfomuseum:description": "\"San Francisco Ballet at Seventy-Five\" celebrates the seventy-fifth anniversary of America's oldest professional ballet company, San Francisco Ballet, by presenting lavish costumes, historical photos, and artifacts from the Company's diverse repertory. The eighteen ballets showcased in the exhibition-ranging from classical works such as Lew Christensen and Michael Smuin's \"Cinderella\" (1973), to more contemporary choreography such as Lar Lubovitch's \"Elemental Brubeck\" (2005)-reflect both San Francisco Ballet's deeply rooted classical foundation and its ability to take chances with innovative programming and commissioned work. The exhibition also includes objects and photographs from many of San Francisco Ballet's artistic \"firsts,\" including the first American production of \"Swan Lake\" (1940) and \"Nutcracker\" (1944).",
