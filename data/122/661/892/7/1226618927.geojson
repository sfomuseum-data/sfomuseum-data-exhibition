    "sfomuseum:description": "Chris McCaw began taking photographs of his family's farm near Manteca in 1997. As the future of this farm became threatened, what began as an exercise in making beautiful images, evolved into a series of photographs of a much more personal tone; the documentation of a receding history. Chris McCaw writes in the forward of his catalog, \"I am committed to capturing a sense of what this family farm, my family's farm, is like. It is my intention for this project to stand as a document of my family's history, and a way of life that is ending in California.\" Chris McCaw is a San Francisco based photographer. These 7\" x 17\" platinum/palladium prints come from his home made large format camera known as a banquet camera. Each print has a brush-applied coating onto 100% rag paper. During print exposure, the areas outside of the negative turns black, rendering each print particularly unique. ",
