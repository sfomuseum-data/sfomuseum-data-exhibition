    "sfomuseum:description": "The exhibition \"Chairs\" is a sequel to the exhibition \"Artists' Furniture.\"  The subject, Chairs, was selected because chairs are artifacts that have become everyday objects.  The exhibition invotes the viewer to look at chairs, rather than sit in them.  The exhibition is divided into areas: historic chairs, historic and contemporary works by architects and designers, chairs by artists, and art works that are drawn from chairs but do not function as a chair.",
