    "sfomuseum:description": "\"Birds of the Pacific Slope\" was the lifework of Andrew Jackson Grayson (1818-69), who was known as \"the Audubon of the West.\" Color lithographs from Grayson's book, recently reprinted by the renowned Arion Press of San Francisco, are accompanied by corresponding bird specimens. A highlight of this exhibition is the juxtaposition of six birds familiar and widespread on the American mainland, with their island cousins, new to science, discovered by Grayson off Mexico's Pacific coast in the 1860s.
